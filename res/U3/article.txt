1 What kinds of parks have you been to? What were they like? 
2 When you think of national parks, what comes to mind first? 
1I wake up to the sound of the wind buffeting the cloth of my tent. Even though the sun is brightly 
shining, telling whether it is morning or night is impossible. I?m above the Arctic Circle, where in summer
the sun never sets. Checking my watch, I see that it is 7:30 a.m. I leave my tent and walk over to the 
mountain edge. Spreading out before me, branches of the Rapa River flow through the valley below. I°Øm 
in the remote far north of Sweden in Sarek National Park, a place with no roads or towns.

Sarek°Øs mountains used to be covered by vast sheets of ice. Around 9,000 years ago, this ice 
melted, leaving behind about 100 glaciers. Soon after, reindeer began to arrive. Following the 
reindeer were the Sami people, who made this territory their home. Getting here is quite difficult, 
so apart from the Sami very few people have ever seen Sarek. In 1909, Sarek was made a national 
park in order to keep the land in its natural state. Though the Sami are allowed to continue their 
traditional way of life in the park, no one else can live here, and all new development is banned
within park boundaries. At the far side of the valley, an ancient Sami cottage is visible. Close by, 
there are a few reindeer feeding on grass.

For hundreds of years, looking after reindeer was 
a way of life for the Sami. They used the reindeer°Øs 
meat for food, their bones for tools, and their skin for 
making clothes and tents. Since reindeer were always 
on the move, the Sami would pick up their tents and 
accompany them. Today, most Sami have houses in 
villages near Sarek and live a modern life just like their 
neighbours. But every spring, a small number of Sami 
still follow their reindeer into the valleys of Sarek, living

1 How many hours a day does the sun shine in summer in Sarek?
2 What steps has the Swedish government taken to keep Sarek in its natural state?

5 Complete the passage using the correct forms of the words from the text. 
In the remote far north of Sweden, in Sarek National Park above the Arctic Circle, I wake 
up to the sound of the wind b  the cloth of my tent. Standing at the e
of the mountain, watching the Rapa River f  through the valley below, I feel so 
b  to be alive and have this rare opportunity to explore this unique  , 
which is almost unknown to the outside world. 
Once covered by v  sheets of ice, Sarek°Øs mountains are home to the Sami, the 
native residents of the park. The Sami lived off reindeer, moved with them, and a
them for hundreds of years. Today, most Sami have left their ancient c  in the 
mountain valleys and live a modern life in villages near Sarek instead. 
To keep its natural state, except for the Sami, no one is allowed to live in Sarek, and all new 
development is b  within the park b . It is hoped that Sarek National Park 
will always remain as it is, natural and beautiful.
6 Work in groups. Discuss these questions.
1 Is it worth making a place like Sarek a national park? Give your reasons.
2 Do you think setting up national parks is an effective way to balance development and the 
protection of nature? Why or why not? 
in tents or old cottages and enjoying their traditions. I am not a Sami, but in Sarek I°Øve adopted
some of their habits. For example, this morning my breakfast is flat bread warmed over a fire, dried 
reindeer meat, and some sweet and sour berries that I found growing near my tent. 
4
After breakfast, I pack my bag and set out again. Since I must carry all of my food and supplies 
with me, my bag weighs about 30 kilograms. If today is anything like yesterday, it will be full of 
sweat and hard work as I hike over this difficult land to my destination on the other side of the 
valley. However, I cannot complain. Being in such a beautiful and wild place makes me feel blessed
to be alive. Here I am, alone under this broad sky, breathing the fresh air, and enjoying this great 
adventure. What could be better?

The Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park was in Jilin and Heilongjiang, with 
stretching all the way to the border and joining with Russia°Øs wildlife reserves. 
This new park is nearly four times larger than the old wildlife park protecting 
Siberian tigers in Northeast China. Over the years, increased development in the area affected 
the tigers°Ø habitat, and it was thought that by 1998 there were only six to nine wild Siberian 
tigers living in the region. However, a on development put in place 
in 2015 resulted in a population increase of the species, and now the area is 
thought to have about 35 tigers and 70 leopards. The problem, however, was that the old 
park was too small to support further population increases. Always , Siberian 
tigers and leopards need large areas to hunt for food. This larger park, with a connection to 
Russia°Øs wildlife reserves across the border, should give these species the natural space they 
need to live in.
